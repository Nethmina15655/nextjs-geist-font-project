Since the current environment is a web-based VSCode server and not a full Android Studio environment, building an Android APK here might not be fully supported or may require additional setup.

To proceed, I suggest:

1. Ensure the Gradle wrapper files (`gradlew`, `gradlew.bat`, and `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`) exist and are configured properly.

2. Adjust the `build.gradle` files to use plugin versions compatible with the environment or use older stable versions.

3. Alternatively, you can download the project and build the APK locally on your machine with Android Studio or a proper Android build environment.

Would you like me to:

- Help you generate the Gradle wrapper files and adjust the build files for compatibility here?

- Or provide instructions and files so you can build the APK locally on your machine with Android Studio?

Please confirm how you want to proceed.
